Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository contains the R code and documentation files for the course "Getting and Cleaning data".

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code assumes all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` explains the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio.

`averages data.txt` is the output.
